# Homework-11-Noite-Taker
This is an application that allows the user to post and retrieve messages on a webpage. All of my work was done in the back-end on the server file. I started by establishing all the required connections for express, path, database branch, and fs. Then I constructed the required routes. The first 2 were super simple and the 3rd was really similar to some code I had written for a previous class activity. All in all it was pretty smooth. I didn't attempt the bonus but I'm sure it wouldn't have been too difficult. I also wanted to mention that my instructor Poornima Sewak told me I could have an extension on this assignment due to illness. Thanks for your time.
